# 📘 Day 7 – OOP Features: Inheritance & Polymorphism

---

## 🔰 Overview

Welcome to **Day 7** of your Python learning journey!
This lesson focused on two important **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts: **Inheritance** and **Polymorphism**.

You explored how classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes, and how multiple classes can share a common interface through polymorphism.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### ✅ Inheritance

* Creating a **parent class** with common attributes/methods.
* Extending the parent class in a **child class**.
* Overriding methods in the child class.
* Real-life analogy: Animal → Dog, Vehicle → FourWheeler.

### ✅ Polymorphism

* Creating a common interface (e.g., `.speak()` or `.move()`) that multiple classes can implement.
* Passing different objects to the same function and getting different behavior.
* Real-life analogy: Different vehicles move differently, different animals make different sounds.

---

## 💡 Skills Sharpened

✔️ Understanding parent-child class relationships.
✔️ Overriding methods to change behavior in child classes.
✔️ Writing functions that work with multiple object types.
✔️ Applying OOP concepts to real-world examples.

## 📌 Quick Tips

* Always call `super().__init__()` when you need to initialize the parent class.
* Use inheritance for **shared behavior**, not just to avoid retyping code.
* Polymorphism helps make your code **more flexible** and **extensible**.

## 🚀 Keep Going!

You now have the tools to model complex systems using OOP principles. Next, try combining **inheritance** and **polymorphism** to design a mini-application — for example, a simulation with different types of vehicles or animals interacting in the same program.

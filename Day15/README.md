we need to do js scripts for 

1st. even odd numbers 
2nd. arry of number that would be **
3rd. all the number shuold be divisble by 5 should be printed

to select an item we use **document.getElementById("Your Id Name from the html element")**
```js
const myheading = documnet.getElementById("Heading");
myheading.textcontent = "Manvith";
myheading.style.colour= "white";
```

the all the getElement things as been outdated as per now a days , the now the industry standard is **queryselector**


HW 
first create a heading using named "java" then select the element and edit the name as "javascript"
then do some styleing

add a java infomation we should a javascript like append.child format 

then we should remove the that and add javascript information by using javascript using create element and we shuold style it

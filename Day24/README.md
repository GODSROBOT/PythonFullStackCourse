We are doing the normaliztion in the SQL Topic
diffrent types are there : 
- 1 NF = This should be unique that cannot be duplicated
- 2 NF = This is partial dependency this can be dependend on 1 or more primary key
- 3 NF = transitive dependancy this will be depended on the Id <= colum A <= next coulm B

- 1NF = removes the repeating values
- 2NF = Remove partial depending
- 3NF = remove transitive depending

- BCNF = Boyce-codd NF = Functional Dependancy

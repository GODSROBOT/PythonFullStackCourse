# 📘 Day 6 – Python Classes & Objects (BMW Cars & Suzuki Bikes)

---

## 🔰 Overview

Welcome to **Day 6** of your Python learning journey!
This lesson was about **creating classes and objects** to model real-world entities.

You built two separate classes — one for **Cars** and one for **Bikes** — and learned how to define attributes, methods, and create multiple instances from the same class.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### ✅ Class Basics

* Defining a class with attributes and methods.
* Using the `__init__` constructor to initialize object properties.
* Assigning default class-level attributes.

### ✅ Creating Objects

* Instantiating multiple objects from the same class.
* Passing different parameters to create distinct instances.

### ✅ Methods

* Defining custom methods (`accelerate`, `braking`, `ppf`) to represent object behaviors.
* Calling methods on different instances.

### ✅ Real-Life Examples

* **Cars Class:** Modeled BMW cars with details like name, cost, speed, and fuel economy.
* **Bikes Class:** Modeled Suzuki bikes with attributes and a method to represent PPF (Paint Protection Film).

## 💡 Skills Sharpened

✔️ Creating reusable class blueprints.
✔️ Working with instance and class attributes.
✔️ Simulating real-world entities in code.
✔️ Encapsulating behavior inside methods.

---

## 📌 Quick Tips

* Keep method names lowercase (e.g., `brake()` instead of `Braking()`) for consistency.
* Use descriptive attribute names for clarity.
* Store repeated values (like brand name) in class attributes to avoid redundancy.

## 🚀 Keep Going!

With the basics of class creation mastered, you’re ready to move into **OOP concepts** like **inheritance** and **polymorphism** in Day 7.

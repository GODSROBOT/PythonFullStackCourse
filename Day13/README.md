* Used `h3` headings for each language section.
* Inserted images (`html.jpeg`, `css.png`, `js.png`) to represent each language.
* Wrote paragraphs explaining each language.
* Applied **15+ CSS properties**:

  * `color`, `background-color`, `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`,
  * `border`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, `width`, `height`,
  * `display`, `flex`, `align-items`, `justify-content`,
  * `text-align`, `line-height`, `letter-spacing`, `font-family`, etc.

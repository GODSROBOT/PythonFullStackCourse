    The modern web is built upon three essential languages — <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> — each playing a unique and complementary role in creating interactive, visually appealing, and functional websites.
    <br><br>
    <strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong> serves as the foundation of every webpage. It structures the content, defines headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML acts like the skeleton of a website, providing a clear layout and ensuring that browsers know how to display different elements. Without HTML, there would be no organized way to present text, images, or media online.
    <br><br>
    <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> adds style and personality to that structure. It controls the look and feel of a website — colors, fonts, spacing, layouts, and responsiveness. CSS transforms a plain HTML document into a polished design. With modern CSS3, developers can create complex layouts using Flexbox and Grid, add smooth transitions, and design responsive interfaces that adapt to all screen sizes.
    <br><br>
    <strong>JavaScript</strong> brings websites to life. It enables interactivity, allowing developers to build dynamic elements such as dropdown menus, image sliders, form validations, and real-time updates without reloading the page. Originally limited to browsers, JavaScript now powers backend systems through environments like Node.js, making it a versatile language for full-stack development.
    <br><br>
    Together, these three technologies form the backbone of web development. HTML lays the groundwork, CSS enhances the presentation, and JavaScript adds the behavior. Understanding how they work together empowers developers to build websites that are not only functional but also visually engaging and interactive.

            <p>
                <strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong> is the standard language used to create and structure web pages on the internet. It acts as the backbone of any website, defining the content and its layout. HTML uses a system of “tags” enclosed in angle brackets, such as &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; for headings, and &lt;a&gt; for hyperlinks. These tags tell the browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements.
                First developed in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee, HTML has evolved through several versions, with HTML5 being the most widely used today. HTML5 introduced new features like &lt;video&gt;, &lt;audio&gt;, and &lt;canvas&gt;, enabling richer multimedia experiences without relying on external plugins.
                Although HTML controls the structure, it is often combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, creating modern, responsive websites. It is a beginner-friendly language and serves as the foundation for anyone learning web development. Without HTML, the internet as we know it—full of interconnected, visually organized pages—would not exist. It remains an essential skill for developers and a core component of the web’s architecture.

            <p>
                <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is the language used to design and style HTML content on the web. While HTML structures a webpage, CSS determines how it looks—controlling colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing. It allows developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites without altering the HTML structure.
                CSS works by applying styles to HTML elements through selectors. These styles can be written inline, in the &lt;style&gt; tag, or in an external .css file. The “cascading” concept means that styles are applied in a priority order: inline styles override internal styles, which in turn override external styles, unless otherwise specified.
                With CSS3, developers gained advanced features like animations, transitions, flexbox, and grid layouts, enabling complex and responsive designs without heavy scripting. CSS also supports media queries, allowing web pages to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
                Together with HTML and JavaScript, CSS forms the foundation of modern web development, making it essential for anyone aiming to create professional, interactive, and aesthetically pleasing websites. Without CSS, the web would be a collection of plain, unstyled pages.

            <h3 id="javascript">JavaScript</h3>
        <p class="info">
            <strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong> is a powerful, high-level programming language primarily used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. While HTML provides the structure and CSS handles the styling, JavaScript adds functionality—allowing developers to respond to user actions, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and update content without reloading the page.
            Introduced in 1995 by Brendan Eich, JavaScript has evolved into one of the most widely used languages in the world. Modern JavaScript supports features such as arrow functions, promises, async/await, and modular programming, making it both beginner-friendly and robust for large-scale applications.
            JavaScript can run directly in the browser as client-side code, and with environments like Node.js, it can also run on servers. It integrates seamlessly with HTML and CSS, enabling the creation of responsive forms, animations, games, and real-time data updates.
            As a core part of the web development triad, JavaScript is essential for building interactive, user-focused experiences, making it a must-learn language for aspiring developers.
